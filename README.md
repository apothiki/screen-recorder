# screen-recorder
A convenient desktop app designed to record the whole screen rather than window!

## Inspiration
Although Windows have its built-in gamebar tools, it can only record the current active *window*. While recording the active window, it can not capture the other windows opened. For example,
- Tray context menu
- Browser's native dropdown menu
- File chooser
- etc.

There are web services allow users to achieve this. However the confidentiality, safety and anonymity are compromised since they often require uploading the videos or registration.

This project aims to create a desktop app for this purpose.

Note: Only support Windows 10 and above since MacOS has built-in tools for this (by pressing `Shift-Command-5`).

## Features
